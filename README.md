# wp-test-demo-java
Project to demonstrate my automation testing skills in Java, against a test Wordpress site. The code assumes I've set up a test Wordpress site using Docker Compose, and running under the URL http://wordpress.local. Tests for this suite will be written in Java using IntelliJ and TestNG, with the Unirest library for hitting Wordpress API endpoints.
